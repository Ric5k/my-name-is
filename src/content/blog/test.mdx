# title

I use coding agents almost exclusively, and they still produce a lot of slop. I don't mind any of that for prototyping but shipping good-quality software is still hard.

By slop, **I mean things like production issues, performance regressions**, bad user experience, or unnecessary complexity. I don't like it growing surface area when it's not needed - it invites more issues in the future. I don't really care about code style/any other type of localized slop.
**hello** 
I don't like the sentiment of "there will be more AI slop and we should just get comfortable with it". It's exhausting. As we move forward we need to end up with very strict codebases where feedback loop is as local as possible and embraces the "shift left" mentality.s
